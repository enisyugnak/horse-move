## How

This is an 8x8 chess board. You click on a tile and game starts.
you may only move as Knight in the chess game. so only L shape is allowed.
once you occupy a tile, its disabled.
so you need to be very carefull for your next move,
or suddenly there may be no move at all and the game over.

and yes, there is totally solution, even more than one.
hope you enjoy playing.
good luck...

## Why...

Well, this is a very first game that I build with react just to practice and learn.
So I practiced some hooks, css grid and different class types for different states...
and also keeping history for all the moves to allow player undo till the beginning was fun.
